We define "genetic alteration caused regulatory event" as defined below.
A genetic alteration occurs in a specific gene, then the alteration further caused the regulation of a downstream biological process.
There are three different regulatory types, neutral regulation (Reg), positive regulation (PosReg) and negative regulation (NegReg).
Finally, event are formed as "gene -- genetic alteration -- trigger word (regulatory type) -- biological process"

rules for extraction:
1. The gene in the event should be isolated gene name or symbol, not containing other words, like "gene", "mutated".
2. One event should contain only single gene and single biological process.
3. The genetic alteration in event should be the change of the gene, like SNPs, or general alteration, e.g. "mutant", "knockdown"".
4. The trigger words in the event should be divided into three regulatory types, e.g. "cause" is neutral regulation, "enhanced" is positive regulation, and "reduced" is negative regulation.
5. The biological process in the event should be isolated concept, not containing other adjective, like "enhanced" and "different", and it's not always the predicate in the sentence.
6. Trigger words keep only the most important words.
7. The event have to include 4 elements, gene, genetic alteration, trigger word and biological process.
8. All elements in the event must be in the sentence.
10. If the event describes negation, mark "Negation" in the regulatory type, e.g. "no association".

Please response me as the following format:
sent-1:
event-1: gene1 -- genetic alteration1 -- trigger word1 (regulatory type1) -- biological process1
event-2: gene2 -- genetic alteration2 -- trigger word2 (regulatory type2) -- biological process2
...

Please extract the events from the following sentences.

Some example:
sent-1: 32449922 Among the 11 ZF-HD genes in rice, the overexpression of OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induces leaf curling by controlling the number and arrangement of bulliform cells.
event-1: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- induces (Reg) -- leaf curling
event-2: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- induces (Reg) -- leaf curling
event-3: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- controlling (Reg) -- number of bulliform cells
event-4: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- controlling (Reg) -- number of bulliform cells
event-5: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- induces (Reg) -- leaf curling
event-6: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- controlling (Reg) -- number of bulliform cells
event-7: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- controlling (Reg) -- arrangement of bulliform cells
event-8: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- controlling (Reg) -- arrangement of bulliform cells

sent-2: 21209026 Introduction of the semi-dominant Bc6 mutant gene into wild-type rice significantly reduced the percentage of cellulose, causing brittle phenotypes.
chain-1: Bc6 -- semi-dominant mutant -- significantly reduced (NegReg) -- percentage of cellulose
chain-1: Bc6 -- semi-dominant mutant -- causing (Reg) -- brittle phenotypes

sent-3: 21963665 Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has altered AM formation.
chain-1: lax panicle2 -- mutant -- altered (Reg) -- AM formation
chain-2: lax2 -- mutant -- altered (Reg) -- AM formation

sent-4: 21807436 Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice.
chain-1: OsPAO -- Knockdown -- cause (Reg) -- plant death phenotypes
chain-2: OsRCCR1 -- knockdown -- cause (Reg) -- plant death phenotypes
