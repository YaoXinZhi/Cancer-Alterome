We define 4 types of entities and 3 types of relations in the sentence.
<Gene> for Gene, <Alt> for Genetic Alteration, <Trigger> for Trigger word, and <BioPro> for Biological Process.
"ThemeOf" denotes the theme relation between <Gene> and <Alt>, or <Trigger> and <BioPro>.
"CauseOf" denotes the causal relation between <Alt> and <Trigger>.
"NoRelation" denotes no relation between the two entities.
I will give you the sentence containing the two tags of entity, and please categorize the relationship between the two entities.
